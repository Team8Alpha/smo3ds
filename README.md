Reason is that the head dev, Moddimation(me) started the codebase in a chaotic way, as this is my first Unity3D project. Now with real life and all, and a lot of performance issues caused by Unity for N3DS, i decided to step down, ultimately stopping development. You may fork and continue this at will, but please do not ask for setup instructions or any of the sort in either server or dm's. Thank you for support up until now, Moddi out.

Super Mario Odyssey for 3DS, unactive demake of the Switch game for 3DS.
